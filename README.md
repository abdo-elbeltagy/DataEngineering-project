# CSEN1095-W20-Project
This a template repository for the CSEN1095 project winter 2020. It contains the data that will be used in this project. 
Good luck :)


## Overview of the used datasets
In this project we are using 3 datasets which are collected from kaggle platform:  
  1. [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)  
  2. [All 250 Country Data](https://www.kaggle.com/souhardyachakraborty/all-250-country-data)  
  3. [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)  
      
      
 ## overview of the project goals and the motivation for it.  
 In this project we would like to find the important factors that affect the global happiness and the global life expectancy, because increasing these features will help the worled lead a happy and consistent life.
 so we are given the three mentioned dataset and our goal is to clean, tidy and engineer their features in order to answer some questions along with the goal of this project.
      

## Descriptive steps used for the work done in this milestone.  
this project was devided into 2 milestones.  
1.  Milestone 1  
  -  Cleaning the data
  -  Tidying the data
  -  Plotting the data
  -  Integrating the data
  -  Exploring your data
  -  Finding your research questions 
  
2. Milestone 2
  -  Feature Engneering
  -  Visualizaion
  -  data piplining using Airfolw
  
  
  ## The data exploration questions..
  in this project we have tackled a group of non trivial questions and provided them with answers through differnt methods of visualization and plotting, these questions are as the following  
  1. since we are interested more about the happiness rank and score, What are the attributes that have impact on the happiness score for countries.
  2. How does 'Literacy rate%' affect the happiness score differently in each continent using the average of both variables during the last five years? or are the countries with high percentage of litracy more happier?  
  3. What is the relative happiness ranking among the main contenents during the last five years and how it is changing with respect to time?
  4. what is the vaiance in happiness score in the different countries at the same continent and are the countries in the same continents affetct the happiness score of each other?  
  5. What are the attributes that have impact on the life_expectancy for the different countries.
  6. What is the ranking of the continents with respect to life expectancy and the change in it from year 2000 to 2015.  
  7. what is the effect of literacy rate on the life expectancy? and does literacy rate affects life-expectancy by the same manner in the different continents?
  
  8. which type countries experience higher life-expectancy the crowded contries or the not corweded ones  
  
  
  ## description of the added features
  
  1. adding a new attribute representing the population density of a country. and from it we added and indicator that indicates whether the country is crouded or not.  
  2. converting the binary features to (0&1)
  3. Applying label encoding for the categorical features.
  4. Scaling for the attributes of features with very high numirical values in order that the machine learning algorithms work with no problems. 
  
  ## Pipeline Descriptions.  
  our pipeline consists of 3 main tasks:  
  1. extracting the data.
  2. transforming the data.
  3. loading the data.
